<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-2043"><p id="p-2126">From a list of files, use space with h to hear all available commands.  These items will be reviewed in this lesson.</p></li>
<li id="li-2044"><p id="p-2127">You can get information about the "pointed to" file in the file list within a folder.  Space with i will allow you to get details about the file.  You will learn what type of file you are focused on, the file size, when the file was last modified, and if the file is protected or unprotected.  Try using space with i when pointed to a variety of files to get an idea of what information you can get.</p></li>
<li id="li-2045"><p id="p-2128">Use space with x to view other types of files.  If you want to view all files in the folder, use space with x until the View All Files option is displayed.  Space with x will toggle to the various file types.</p></li>
<li id="li-2046"><p id="p-2129">You can determine the order in which files are displayed by using space with v.  Repeat space with v to change the order in which the files are viewed. Space with v is a toggle.  The choices are name order, date order, size order, or type of file order.  Explore this option by using space with v to toggle to a different order type.  Look at your list of files to see how this impacts how your files are ordered.</p></li>
<li id="li-2047"><p id="p-2130">To copy the pointed to file, press backspace with y.  Try this now.  You will need to choose the destination folder for the file to be placed in.  However, the file is just being copied.  The original will remain in the location it was copied from in the first place.</p></li>
<li id="li-2048"><p id="p-2131">Backspace with m will "move" a file.  If you move a file, it will no longer remain in its original location.  Keep in mind that moving a file and copying a file are similar, but not quite the same.</p></li>
<li id="li-2049"><p id="p-2132">You can rename the "pointed to" file.  Press enter with r, then type the new name.  Press enter when you finish.</p></li>
<li id="li-2050"><p id="p-2133">Backspace with p will protect or unprotect a "pointed to" file.  When you use this command on a file in the list, you will then need to press p to protect the file, u to unprotect the file, or enter to leave the option unchanged.  If you protect a file, when you are actually in the file you will be unable to make changes to the file.</p></li>
<li id="li-2051"><p id="p-2134">You can mark a file or mark all files.  Space with m will mark the pointed to file.  Enter with low g will mark all files.</p></li>
<li id="li-2052"><p id="p-2135">Backspace with m will move marked files if you have any marked.  Otherwise, backspace with m will move the pointed to file.</p></li>
<li id="li-2053"><p id="p-2136">You can copy the marked items or delete the marked items.  Backspace with y will copy the marked items.  Backspace with dots1 4 will delete the marked items.</p></li>
<li id="li-2054"><p id="p-2137">As time, use the above commands to become more familiar with how efficient they can be when managing files.</p></li>
