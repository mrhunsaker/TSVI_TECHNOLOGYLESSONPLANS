<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">3.9</span> <span class="title">Appendix A setting up the BrailleNote touch for the First Time</span>
</h2>
<p id="p-2967">To turn on the BrailleNote Touch, hold down the Power button for about 2 seconds. A "Starting Keysoft," message will appear in Braille. After about 5 seconds, a Braille hourglass will appear represented by a dot moving in a circular motion. The first time you start the BrailleNote Touch, a Welcome message will appear. At this point, pressing the right-most thumb key will take you through an excellent tutorial that will help you get started. If you need to increase speech volume, press the Volume Up key several times.</p>
<p id="p-2968">To exit the tutorial, press Space+dots4,5,6; you will land on the Exit Tutorial button. Press Space+dot1 a couple of times to arrow up to the "Do not launch this tutorial next time I Restart," checkbox, and check it by pressing a cursor router key above the box. Now, press Space+dots4,5,6 to return to the "Exit Tutorial," button and press Enter. This will exit the tutorial and open the Setup Wizard dialog. You can re-start the tutorial any time from the Options menu, (see below).</p>
<p id="p-2969">When you exit the tutorial, a Startup dialog will open. By default, the English language is selected – so press Space+dots4,5,6 to move to the end of the dialog; you will land on the Start button. Here, press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2970">You will be prompted to select a Wi-fi connection. Arrow to your Wi-fi connection by using the arrow keys: Space+dot4 for Down Arrow or Space+dot1 for up arrow; then press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2971">You will be prompted for a password which must be typed in computer Braille. Press a cursor routing key above the edit box; then type the password. An eight-dot computer Braille code is used. Letters are typed normally with no contractions. Use dot7 to capitalize a letter – for example, you would make a capital A by pressing dots1,7. dot7 is created by pressing the Backspace key. Numbers are dropped Nemeth numbers. Period is created using dots4,6. An At sign is created by pressing dots4,7. A computer Braille table is included as Appendix A.</p>
<p id="p-2972">After typing the Password, Press the Next thumb key until you get to the Connect button; then press Enter, or press one of the cursor routing keys above the Connect button.</p>
<p id="p-2973">When the connection has been established, you will receive a "Got Google," message. Since most school accounts require that you use Chrome to log into the school account, I skip this account setup process and have a District IT representative set up the account. But for this example, I will show how to set up a standard Google account.</p>
<p id="p-2974">Press Space+dots4,5,6 to get to the end of the dialog and click the Yes button.</p>
<p id="p-2975">Enter the account Email and Password using computer Braille; then press Enter on the Next button.</p>
<p id="p-2976">When the Google Services message appears, press Space+dots4,5,6 to get to the OK button; then press Enter. You will get a "Signing in" message.</p>
<p id="p-2977">When the Google Terms window appears, press space+dots4,5,6 to get to the bottom of the screen and press Enter on the Next button.</p>
<p id="p-2978">At this point, you will be prompted for the user's First and Last Name. These can be entered using either contracted or uncontracted Braille. This is important, because it is used to identify the machine and is automatically inserted when, for example, you create a new Email address. The user's first and last name is required even if you skip account setup.</p>
<p id="p-2979">Enter the first name; press the Next thumb key, and then enter the last name. When you press the Next thumb key after entering the last name, the account will be created and you will be at the Main Menu.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-2980">Students can quickly connect to Wi-fi at school or at home as follows:</p>
<p id="p-2981">At the Main Menu, Press Enter+Q for quick settings.</p>
<p id="p-2982">Press Space+dot4 to arrow down to Wifi disconnected and press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2983">Arrow down to desired network and press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2984">In the edit box, type the network password using computer Braille; then press the Next thumb several times to get to the Connect button and press Enter.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-118"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.9.2</span> <span class="title">Connecting to a School Account</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-2985">It is possible to set up the BrailleNote Touch and add the user's name, but skip account setup. To set up the account at a later time, press Space+O for Options, and then press A followed by Enter to open Android settings.</p>
<p id="p-2986">Press A two times to get to Add account; then press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2987">Press G for Google; then press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2988">Press E to get to the existing account button; then press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2989">Enter the Email address using computer Braille; then press the Next thumb key to get to the password box and enter the password. Now, press the Next thumb key to get to the Next button and press Enter. On the next screen for the Google agreement, press Space+dots4,5,6 to get to the OK button and press Enter. On the next screen, Google Services, choose the Next button and press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-2990">At this point, press the Home button to return to the main menu.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-119"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.9.3</span> <span class="title">Note on School Accounts</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-2991">Many\ school accounts  require that you connect to the Internet using the Chrome browser before the account can be set up. An IT person can do this quickly as follows:</p>
<p id="p-2992">Triple-tap the Home button to unload Keysoft.</p>
<p id="p-2993">Click All Applications; then choose Chrome and complete the account setup.</p>
<p id="p-2994">Triple-Tap the Home button to Enable Keysoft.</p>
<p id="p-2995">You will now be able to download apps from the Play Store and share documents with Google Drive.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-120"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">3.9.4</span> <span class="title">User Settings</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-2996">Personalized preferences can be set up as follows:</p>
<p id="p-2997">Press Space+O for the Options menu.</p>
<p id="p-2998">Use Space+dot4 to arrow down to Configure Primary Language profile and press Enter. Leave the text-to-speech engine set to BrailleNote Touch Acapela for now.</p>
<p id="p-2999">Continue pressing the Next thumb key until you get to Preferred Braille Grade for entry. Leave this on the default which is Literary Braille.</p>
<p id="p-3000">Leave Preferred Braille Grade for Display set to Literary Braille.</p>
<p id="p-3001">Leave Computer Braille Table set to English US, Liblouis.</p>
<p id="p-3002">Now, when you press the Next thumb key, you get to Literary Braille Table, English UEB Duxbury grade 1. Press Enter to open available options.</p>
<p id="p-3003">Choose the first choice, English UEB Grade 2, then press Enter to select it.</p>
<p id="p-3004">Now, press the triangular Back button on the front of the machine, or press Space+E to return to the Options menu. And press the Next thumb key.</p>
<p id="p-3005">If you wish, you can configure the Secondary Language profile to English UEB Duxbury as well. That way, if someone presses Enter+L, (the profile toggle), and inadvertently loads the secondary English profile, the Braille setting won't change.</p>
<p id="p-3006">For now, arrow down to Keyboard Settings and press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-3007">The first option, Keyboard Echo, is set to both characters and words by default. Most students prefer either Word echo or no echo. For now, change it to Word echo as follows:</p>
<p id="p-3008">Press Enter on Keyboard Settings.</p>
<p id="p-3009">Arrow down to Words and press Enter to set it.</p>
<p id="p-3010">Now, arrow down to the Keyboard Clicks checkbox and press a cursor routing key above the box to uncheck it, (most students prefer a quiet keyboard when taking notes in class).</p>
<p id="p-3011">We don't need to reconfigure the thumb keys at this point, so press the Back button or Space+E to return to the Options menu.</p>
<p id="p-3012">Next, arrow down to Miscellaneous Settings and press Enter.</p>
<p id="p-3013">Arrow down to Navigation Sounds and press a cursor routing key above the box to uncheck it.</p>
<p id="p-3014">Tutorial. If you arrow down two more times, you will come to Launch Tutorial. If you press Enter on this option, the introductory tutorial will be loaded.</p>
<p id="p-3015">For now, press Down Arrow, (Space+dot4), two more times to get to Format Markers settings. This is an option that students may wish to change from time to time. The default is to include a $\$$ P as a marker whenever there is a hard line break; example, to show one or two blank lines between paragraphs. This looks like "edp" in Braille. This is good for editing; for example, when changing paragraph settings while formatting a document, or when editing a document containing Nemeth where it may be necessary to delete a paragraph containing a math image.</p>
<p id="p-3016">However, when reading documents or books, most students prefer that a paragraph starts on a new line with a two-space indent at the left. You can set this as follows:</p>
<p id="p-3017">Press Enter to open Format Markers settings.</p>
<p id="p-3018">Arrow down to New Line Rendering, and press Enter. This is set, by default, to New Line Marker. Press Enter to change it.</p>
<p id="p-3019">Arrow down to the two spaces option; then press Enter to set it.</p>
<p id="p-3020">Now, arrow down about 7 times to get to Braille Message Display time in seconds. This determines how long a message is displayed in Braille. The default is 3 seconds; however, fast Braille readers may prefer 1 or 2 seconds. Press Enter. You will be prompted to enter a value of 1 to 30 seconds in computer Braille. For now, press 2 and then Enter to set it.</p>
<p id="p-3021">At this point, press the Back button or Space+E to return to the Options menu.</p>
<p id="p-3022">Here, press the letter A to get to Android System settings; then press Enter. We want to change the display duration setting. This is because the default setting of 2 minutes will cause the screen to lock whenever the BrailleNote Touch is inactive for two minutes. At this point, the student must tap the Power button and press Space+U to unlock the screen.</p>
<p id="p-3023">Press the letter D two times to get to Display; then press Enter. The default is shown as 2 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-3024">Now,\ press Enter to show the options.  Most students arrow down to 30 minutes and press Enter to set it. If this is done, it is important to lock the screen manually by tapping the Power button to lock the screen whenever the BrailleNote Touch will be inactive. This saves power.</p>
<p id="p-3025">We are done with Settings, so press the triangle-shaped Back button about five times to return to the Main Menu.</p></section></section>
