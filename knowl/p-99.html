<p>The BrailleNote is a computer. With it, you can complete word processing tasks, use the planner to set and keep appointments, and send and receive e-mail messages. Just like on the computer, there is often more than one way to complete a task. This is true for creating folders. In this lesson, you will learn two ways of creating folders. After practicing both methods, you may decide which one is best for you.</p>
